## Overview
The **blocked weighted bootstrap** is an estimation technique for use with data from two-stage cluster sampled surveys in which either prior weighting (e.g. *population-proportional sampling* or *PPS* as used in [Standardized Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transitions (SMART)](https://smartmethodology.org/) surveys) or *posterior weighting* (e.g. as used in [Rapid Assessment Method (RAM)](https://rapidsurveys.io/ramOPmanual/) and [Simple Spatial Sampling Method (S3M)](https://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/id/eprint/2572543) surveys) is implemented.
