**Open Data Kit (ODK)** is a free and open-source set of tools which help organizations author, field, and manage mobile data collection solutions. ODK provides an out-of-the-box solution for users to:

* Build a data collection form or survey;
* Collect the data on a mobile device and send it to a server; and
* Aggregate the collected data on a server and extract it in useful formats.

`odkr` is a set of interface and utility tools for a **useR** working with ODK. The package currently has two classes of functions: 1) *data processing* tools; and, 2) *ODK-R interface* functions.

For *data processing*, there are currently three functions included which can be used to perform typical data processing tasks associated with working with ODK-collected datasets such as renaming variables in a dataset, expansion of responses to questions that allow more than one answer and merging of nested datasets.

For *ODK-R interface*, included are a set of functions that work via a command line interface with the Java application **ODK Briefcase** for fetching and pushing Open Data Kit (ODK) forms and their contents. It can be used to gather and aggregate data from the mobile client **ODK Collect** when there is no internet connectivity, when there is no **ODK Aggregate Server** set-up or when an **ODK Aggregate Server** is not preferred. Current production version of **ODK Briefcase** is v1.8.0 and an executable `.jar` file can be downloaded from the Open Data Kit [website](https://opendatakit.org/use/briefcase/).

As of **ODK Briefcase** version 1.4.4, a scriptable command line interface (CLI) to the Java application has been available. This package provides an R interface to **ODK Briefcase** via the available CLI to pull forms from a remote **ODK Aggregate  Server** or from a local ODK folder `/odk` collected from mobile clients. This package has a function that downloads the latest version of **ODK Briefcase** (currently v1.8.0) and additional functions that use the CLI of **ODK Briefcase** to perform data extraction and data export. This package requires Java 8 installed. Java 8 can be downloaded from [here](https://java.com/en/download/).
